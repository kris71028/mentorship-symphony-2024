# Data Scientist Job Descriptions Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze web-scraped data containing job descriptions for data scientists and engineers. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

## Objectives
- Perform basic cleaning operations on the dataset.
- Generate plots for the following:
  - Distribution of salaries
  - Top 10 most frequently used words in the job descriptions
  - Correlation between ratings and salaries
  - Correlation between employee number and salaries
  - Count of easy apply jobs
  - Average salary by company size

## Materials
- **Dataset:** [Data Scientist Jobs on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/data-scientist-jobs)
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook/Lab
- **Visualization Library:** Matplotlib

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains the raw and processed data files.
